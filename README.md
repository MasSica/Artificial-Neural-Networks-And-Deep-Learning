# Artificial Neural Networks And Deep Learning Projects 

## Introduction

This repository contains all the work carried out for the AN2DL class at Poltecnico di Milano, each folder contains a report in pdf format explaining the whole procedure followed for the development of the two projects. 

The work is the result of a team effort carried out with Marco Labate and Arnab Mondal. 

## Structure

The first folder contains a neural network design for image classification aimed to classify images according to the number of people wearing a mask ðŸ˜·

The second contains an algorithm developed in the context of an EU sposored competition ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º for the segmentation images related to the world of precision agricoluture using autonomous robots ðŸ¤–.

For our solution we explored different models like ResNet, Xception, VGG etc.. you will be able to find the code for each of them here in the form of a jupyter notebook!
